    "# Implementing a file transfer application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will be implementing your own file transfer application and put it to test. Similarly to how you implemented a messaging protocol, in this exercise you will create a simple program to transfer files from a server to a client. Then, you will analyze the performance of your application in different network conditions.\n",

    "### Emulating a network\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class (and, more broadly, in this course), you will use Mininet to emulate a network connecting clients and emulating different conditions. Mininet is a network emulator with which you can create a custom network of virtual hosts, switches, controllers, and links, all on a single computer. The virtual devices in the emulated network can run real programs; anything that can run on Linux can also run on a Mininet device. This makes Mininet a valuable tool for quick and easy simulation of protocols and network measurements. This Introduction to Mininet is a helpful guide to get started with the Mininet Python API. The Mininet website has additional resources if youâ€™re interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we will see Mininet more in detail in future classes, today you won't need to explore its details, but you will only use wrapper functions already provided to you.\n",
